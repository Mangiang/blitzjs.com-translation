# blitzjs.com Translation

This repo contains resources and scripts to enable translations of https://blitzjs.com.

## How it works

- The english repo is our source of truth: https://github.com/blitz-js/blitzjs.com
- Each translation get's it's own repo and subdomain like: https://github.com/blitz-js/es.blitzjs.com
- On a periodic schedule (currently every Monday), a bot will open a PR to each translation repo with the changes from the main english repo. The maintainers of the translation will then make any further translations if needed before merging that PR.

## Contributing to translations

Check the https://github.com/blitz-js repos to see if there is a [lang-code].blitzjs.com repo for your language. If there is, open issue #1 in that repo which will be titled "Translation Progress". That issue tracks the translation process and has instructions on how to help.

## Starting a new translation

If you would like to be the maintainer of a new translation, submit a PR adding a new file `{lang-code}.json`
to the `langs` folder with the following information:

- Language name (in English please)
- [Language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
- List of maintainers

For example:

```json
{
  "name": "Spanish",
  "code": "es",
  "maintainers": ["juanm04", "ntgussoni"]
}
```

We prefer more than one maintainer on each repo, so if you're by yourself, we'll leave the PR open for others to join in. If you are a group, please have at least one person other than the PR opener comment, to make sure all people listed actually want to be part of the translation! If after some time, nobody else joins to your group, we'll set `branchProtection` to `false` so you can do the translation on your own.

Also, please read the [Maintainer Responsibilities](/docs/maintainer-guide.md#maintainer-responsibilities) and make sure that you are comfortable with the responsibilities listed.

Once the PR is accepted, the bot will:

- Create a new repository for you at `blitz-js/{lang-code}.blitzjs.com`
- Add/invite all maintainers listed to the repository
- Create an issue from [PROGRESS.template.md](/docs/PROGRESS.template.md) in the new repository to track your translation progress

You may want to [pin](https://help.github.com/articles/pinning-an-issue-to-your-repository/) the generated issue to make it easier to find.

See [Maintainer Tips](/docs/maintainer-guide.md/#tips) for additional advice on how to manage your repository.

Happy translating!

## Adding a maintainer

If you are currently a maintainer of a translation and want to add another member, send a pull request to this repo updating `langs/{lang-code}.json`, where `{lang-code}` is the language code of the repo you want to be a maintainer of.

If you are interested in becoming a maintainer for a translation, please ask one of the current maintainers if they would like to add you. While different maintainers can have different requirements, usually they look for people who have already contributed to the translation already, either by translating or reviewing.

## Before publishing

1. Review your translations and make sure that the pages listed in "Core Pages" are fully translated. Run the site yourself locally to make sure there are no bugs or missing translations.
2. Ask @flybayer to add {lang-code}.blitzjs.com as a subdomain.
3. Submit a PR to [blitz-js/blitzjs.com](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitzjs.com) adding the language in the dropdown and the welcome message.
4. Celebrate! üéâüåê
